# Covid-Mask-Detection

This checks if you are wearing a mask , it detects via webcam and then displays 'Mask' or 'No mask' accordingly.

Note : In main.py file , replace 'mask_detection_model.h5' with your own model . I couldn't attach mine cause it was greater than 25mb , if you know a way to upload then please let me know. Thank you!
